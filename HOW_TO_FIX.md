# How to Fix Your GitHub Profile README

## The Problem

Your GitHub profile README is not displaying because the **repository name doesn't match your GitHub username**.

## Why This Happens

For a README to appear on your GitHub profile page (at `https://github.com/YourUsername`), GitHub requires:

1. ✅ A repository with the **exact same name** as your username
2. ✅ The repository must be **public**
3. ✅ The repository must contain a **README.md** file

Currently:
- Your username is: `AphexTtwin`
- Your repository is named: `ReadME` ❌

## How to Fix It

You have two options:

### Option 1: Rename This Repository (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository settings: `https://github.com/AphexTtwin/ReadME/settings`
2. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
3. Click "Rename repository"
4. Change the repository name from `ReadME` to `AphexTtwin` (must match exactly)
5. Click "I understand, rename repository"

After renaming, your profile README will appear at `https://github.com/AphexTtwin`

### Option 2: Create a New Repository

1. Go to `https://github.com/new`
2. Name the repository exactly: `AphexTtwin`
3. Make it **Public**
4. Initialize with a README
5. Copy the content from this README.md to the new repository

## Verify It's Working

After fixing, check your profile at: `https://github.com/AphexTtwin`

Your beautiful README with the "Carpe Diem" theme should now be visible!

## Additional Notes

- The repository name is **case-sensitive** - it must match your username exactly
- Your current README.md content is perfect and will work once the repository is renamed
- No code changes are needed - just a repository rename

---

**Quick Summary:** Rename this repository from `ReadME` to `AphexTtwin` and your profile README will work! ✨
